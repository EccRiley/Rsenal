#' @title a(R)senal of assorted R packages developed over the years
#'
#' @description This is mainly a collection of random, or more accurately, clusters of random R functions
#' I've written for personal or work projects over the years.  I don't expect it to be immediately 
#' useful to anyone.  For now it's mostly my cloud storage (with nice documentation) for R functions
#' that I use repeatedly.  Some functions are fairly general purpose while others were developed for specific
#' problems are not super generalized.
#' 
#' @details Main topics: manipulating igraph objects, model validation, scaling and transforming data.
